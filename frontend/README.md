# Quiz System Frontend

This project is a small web interface built with **Vue.js** and **TypeScript**. It interacts with the backend API to manage quiz questions.

## Available Scripts

Run these commands from the `frontend` directory:

```bash
npm install   # install dependencies
npm run dev   # start a development server on http://localhost:3000
npm run build # build for production
```

Ensure the backend is running (default on port `9000`) so API requests can be processed.
