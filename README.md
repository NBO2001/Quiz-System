# Quiz-System

This repository contains the components needed to run the quiz application.

- **backend** – a Scala Play application exposing the API.
- **question_extrator** – utilities for parsing raw text into questions.
- **frontend** – a Vue.js project written in TypeScript that consumes the API.

Refer to each directory's README for setup instructions.
