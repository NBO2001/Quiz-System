### How to contribute

We use the scala fmt to keep our codebase tidy and clean. Please, read the [docs](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/) to set up your dev environment properly.
You can also format the code by issuing the following command:

```
sbt scalafmt
```

### Running the project

To start the API locally use:

```
sbt run
```

The application reads its configuration from `conf/application.conf`.

### Running tests

Execute unit tests with:

```
sbt test
```
